# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
SQL work

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this project we are using SQL skill to retrieve data from different tables, and joining tables to create new one to find out about the number of people who will retire in the company to plan ahead and hire new staff according to number of opening for each department.
There are two important tasks that we need to find out how many peoples are retiring per title, and also the number of employees who are retiring and fit into mentorship program. In this way we can plan that how many employees we can hire for each title within the company, and utilize some of most experienced seniors to train those new hires.
We created an ERD as a road map on tables that we had and their relationships that helps in the process of creating new tables. 
Please refer below for ERD image and details on table's relationships:

## Results: 

* Senior engineers are retiring the most and that can be hard to fullfil because it is required a specific skill set and experience if it is not planned properly.

* Managers roles are the easiest to get filled as the number of people who are leaving is just 2 and can be easily filled.

* The retiring_titles shows that we can promote some people and also use senior engineers and senior staff the most for mentorship program as a huge number of retirement will happen in those two titles.

* Mentorship program will require them to be 56 years old and retiring to be qualified.
