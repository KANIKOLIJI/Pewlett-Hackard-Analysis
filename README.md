# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
SQL work

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this project we are using SQL skill to retrieve data from different tables, and joining tables to create new one to find out about the number of people who will retire in the company to plan ahead and hire new staff according to number of opening for each department.
There are two important tasks that we need to find out how many peoples are retiring per title, and also the number of employees who are retiring and fit into mentorship program. In this way we can plan that how many employees we can hire for each title within the company, and utilize some of most experienced seniors to train those new hires.
We created an ERD as a road map on tables that we had and their relationships that helps in the process of creating new tables. 
Please refer below for ERD image and details on table's relationships:

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
